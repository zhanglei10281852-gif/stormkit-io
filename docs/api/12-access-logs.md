# Access Logs API

Access logs contain one entry per HTTP request served by Stormkit for your
environment — the path, status code, client IP, user agent, how many bytes were
sent and how long the request took to serve. They are operational request logs,
not visitor analytics: bot traffic
is included and the client IP and user agent are not masked.

These are distinct from **runtime logs**, which contain the output of your
server side rendered pages and API functions and are returned by
[`GET /v1/deployments/{id}/runtime-logs`](/docs/api/deployments).

This endpoint is also available as the `get_access_logs` MCP tool — see the
[MCP Server](/docs/api/mcp) docs.

## GET /v1/access-logs

Returns access logs for the environment, newest first.

**Base URL:** `https://api.stormkit.io`

**Authentication:** At least an environment-level API key passed as the `Authorization` header.

### Query parameters

All filters are optional and are combined with AND.

| Parameter  | Type    | Required    | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `envId`    | string  | Conditional | Required when using an app, team, or user-level API key. Environment-level keys do not require this parameter.                                     |
| `from`     | string  | No          | Only return requests at or after this unix timestamp, in seconds. **Defaults to 24 hours ago.**                                                   |
| `to`       | string  | No          | Only return requests at or before this unix timestamp, in seconds. Defaults to now.                                                               |
| `domainId` | string  | No          | Only return requests served for this domain.                                                                                                      |
| `hostName` | string  | No          | Only return requests for this host name, e.g. `www.example.org`.                                                                                  |
| `clientIp` | string  | No          | Only return requests originating from this IP address.                                                                                            |
| `method`   | string  | No          | Only return requests with this HTTP method, e.g. `GET`.                                                                                           |
| `path`     | string  | No          | Only return requests whose path starts with this value.                                                                                           |
| `status`   | number  | No          | Only return requests answered with this HTTP status code.                                                                                         |
| `isBot`    | boolean | No          | `true` returns only bot traffic, `false` only non-bot traffic. Omit to return both.                                                               |
| `minDurationMs` | number | No       | Only return requests that took at least this many milliseconds to serve — e.g. `500` to inspect the latency tail. Requests logged before durations were recorded are excluded. |
| `cursor`   | string  | No          | Pagination cursor. Pass `pagination.cursor` from the previous response back verbatim to fetch the next page. Treat it as opaque — its encoding may change. |
| `limit`    | number  | No          | How many entries to return per page. Defaults to `100`, maximum `1000`. Values above the maximum are clamped rather than rejected.                 |

> Queries are always bounded in time so that they only scan the relevant
> partitions. If you omit `from`, the last 24 hours are returned.
