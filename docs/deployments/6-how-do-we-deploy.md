# Stormkit Deployment Overview

Stormkit leverages AWS infrastructure for its cloud deployment. Each deployment on Stormkit can encompass three types of files: static files, server files, and API files, all securely stored in our S3 buckets.

## Folder Structure

By default, Stormkit looks for a top-level `.stormkit` subfolder with the following structure:

- `public/`
- `server/`
- `api/`

To modify the working directory, navigate to **Your App** > **Environments** > **Config** > **Deployment settings** > **Build** and update the `Root Directory` setting.

To specify a different subfolder other than `.stormkit`, visit **Your App** > **Environments** > **Config** > **Deployment settings** > **Build** and update the `Output folder` setting. If changed, the folder structure mentioned above is also validated against this folder. If it differs, the entire content of the directory will be uploaded.

Setting an `Output folder` takes precedence over the `.stormkit` convention: when it is set to anything other than `.stormkit`, the top-level `.stormkit/public` and `.stormkit/server` folders are no longer detected. Leave it empty if your build emits the `.stormkit` structure.

If the deployment lacks a `.stormkit` subfolder and the output folder isn't specified, Stormkit checks for these common subfolders:

- `out`
- `output`
- `dist`
- `build`
- `public`

If none are found, Stormkit uploads everything under the `Root Directory`.

## Server files

In the `server` subfolder, an entry point is determined by locating one of the following files:

- `index.js`
- `server.js`
- `main.js`

These files can also have the `mjs` and `cjs` extensions. If none are found, the function returns a 404 error.

The entry file must export a function named `handler`, wrapped by our `serverless` helper, to receive standard Node.js Request and Response objects.

```ts
import serverless from '@stormkit/serverless'

export const handler = serverless(
  async (req: http.IncomingMessage, res: http.ServerResponse) => {
    res.write('Hello from ' + req.url)
    res.end()
  }
)
```

## API files

Our API files follow the file system routing, as detailed in our [dedicated section](/docs/features/writing-api) for API Files.

Each function should be in a separate file and export a default method:

```ts
export default async (req: http.IncomingMessage, res: http.ServerResponse) => {
  res.write('Hello from ' + req.url)
  res.end()
}
```

In this case, the `serverless` wrapper is omitted because the API function has its own entry file, handling the routing mechanism and loading the appropriate file.

## Static files

All files under the `.stormkit/public` (or the configured output folder) will be deployed to our S3 bucket and served by our Load Balancer as static files.

### Error pages

A request that matches no static file and no function is answered with your
deployment's error page: the file configured as `errorFile`, or `404.html`,
`500.html` or `error.html` when none is configured. The status code is always a
real `404` — never a `200` carrying your app shell.

### Markdown representations

Turn **Markdown representations** on under **Environment** > **Config** >
**Redirects**, and Stormkit serves any `.md` file in your output as a second
representation of the page next to it. `/docs/getting-started.md` published
alongside `/docs/getting-started.html` means:

- `GET /docs/getting-started` with `Accept: text/markdown` answers with the
  markdown, as `text/markdown; charset=utf-8`.
- The same URL with a browser's `Accept` still answers with the HTML, and so
  does a client that accepts neither — negotiation only ever adds a
  representation, it never refuses a request that used to succeed.
- `q` values are honoured, so `Accept: text/html;q=0.9, text/markdown;q=0.5`
  still gets HTML.
- `q` values are read from the most specific media range that matches, and a
  type the client named explicitly beats one it only covered with a wildcard —
  `Accept: text/markdown, */*` gets the markdown, a bare `Accept: */*` gets the
  HTML.
- The converse follows: a `q` on `text/html` is read from the `text/html` range
  alone, so a wildcard at a higher `q` outranks it and
  `Accept: text/html;q=0.9, */*` gets the markdown even though it never named
  markdown. A client that wants the page should name `text/html` at full weight,
  which every browser and HTTP library already does.
- Listing order carries no weight, so `Accept: text/markdown, text/html` is a tie
  and gets the HTML. Say it with a `q` instead.
- A `q` outside the `0`–`1` range is clamped into it.
- Every answer carries `Vary: Accept`, so a CDN caches the two variants
  separately instead of serving one to the wrong client, and both share the
  page's cache policy.

The homepage negotiates through `index.md`, and error pages through `404.md` or
`error.md`. This is what [acceptmarkdown.com](https://acceptmarkdown.com)
describes, and it is how an agent reads your documentation without scraping the
rendered page.

The setting defaults to off: a build that copies its markdown sources into the
output keeps serving exactly what it served before until you turn it on.

It is also the `markdown` field on the [environment API](/docs/api/environments)
and on the `create_environment` / `update_environment` MCP tools, so an agent can
enable it on an environment it just created.

### Converting pages that ship no markdown

Negotiation only covers pages whose build published a `.md` file next to them.
**Convert pages without a .md file** is a second, separate setting that fills the
gap: when a page has no twin, Stormkit converts the page's own HTML and serves
that instead.

- A `.md` file you publish yourself always wins. Conversion never overrides
  authored markdown, and enabling `markdown` on its own changes nothing.
- The whole page is converted, navigation included, rather than an article being
  guessed at. Output is CommonMark: headings, lists, links, tables, images,
  blockquotes and fenced code blocks all carry over, while `<script>`, `<style>`,
  `<noscript>` and `<template>` are dropped.
- Pages above a megabyte, and pages whose markdown would exceed two, are served
  as HTML instead.
- The converted page is also fetchable at its own `.md` URL, so a link to
  `/docs/getting-started.md` resolves even though the build never published one.
- Pages rendered in the browser have nothing to convert. A client-rendered
  application publishes an empty shell, so its markdown is empty too — if that
  is what your pages are, this setting is not for you. Pages produced by a
  server function never reach the deployment's file list and keep serving HTML.
- Conversion happens once per page and is cached for the life of the deployment.

Both settings default to off.
